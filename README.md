  ### 4. Graduate Admission Prediction Using ANN

This project demonstrates a neural network-based approach to predict graduate admissions using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).  
It includes data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation steps.

**Key Features:**
- Input features: GRE, TOEFL, university rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, research experience
- Output: Probability of admission
- Model: Multi-layer ANN using Keras/TensorFlow
- Visualization of training and test results

You can find the full implementation in the file:  
`Graduate Admission Predction using ANN.ipynb`  

**Usage:**
1. Open the notebook and follow the instructions to preprocess data and train the model.
2. Adjust model parameters as needed for experimentation.
3. Evaluate predictions and visualize results.
